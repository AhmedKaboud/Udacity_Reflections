Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.I need to use remote repository when i collaborate with  team in one projectand need to share the latest version between us and if i need to work on one project from different computers. Also, when i need to share my code with another one. and using remote repository represents a backup to the local project, so i can get it if my PC blows up.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Gitautomatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. I may not need these changes from other contributer to be locally because i work on another diferent feature Or may be the local more updated than remote repo.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
A. Forks -> means to copy the repo in GitHub another repo on GitHub location.
Clone -> to copy the repo from remote repo on Github to your local repo or to copy the local repo to another place in the local machine.
brnches -> to make another path of the repo to modify it without modifing the origial version or to work in a team each one work on branch and merge them later.
